0x06. Regular expression


A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.
